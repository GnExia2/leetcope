## [55. Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/description/)

### Problem:

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum
Â             jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```

### Solution:

See [45. Jump Game II](./045.%20Jump%20Game%20II.md). If the range does not expand at some point, we know it is stuck.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var canJump = function(nums) {
  const len = nums.length
  let left = 0
  let right = 1
  while (right < len) {
    let rNext = right
    for (let i = left; i < right; i++) {
      const rNextAtmp = i + nums[i] + 1
      if (rNextAtmp > rNext) {
        rNext = rNextAtmp
      }
    }
    if (rNext === right) { return false }
    left = right
    right = rNext
  }
  return true
};
```
