## [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)

### Problem:

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

Given `"abcabcbb"`, the answer is `"abc"`, which the length is 3.

Given `"bbbbb"`, the answer is `"b"`, with the length of 1.

Given `"pwwkew"`, the answer is `"wke"`, with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, `"pwke"` is a subsequence and not a substring.

### Solution:

Keep tracking the rightest qualified substring.

```
 start          end
   |             |
   ======c=======c······
   |<--length-->|

         start   end->
          |      | 
   ······c======c======
          |<---length--->
```

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(str) {
  const len = str.length
  if (len <= 1) { return len }

  const indicies = { [str[0]]: 0 }
  let max = 1
  for (let s = 0, e = 1; e < len; e++) {
    if (indicies[str[e]] >= s) {
      s = indicies[str[e]] + 1
    }
    max = Math.max(e - s + 1, max)
    indicies[str[e]] = e
  }

  return max
};
```
